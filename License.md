# License Background

This license was derived by studying the JFLAP 7.0 license at
http://www.jflap.org/jflaptmp/ created by Susan H. Rodger, Duke University.
Since this author has used and learned a great deal from JFLAP, and the
purpose of this software is similar (i.e., educate students about the
topif of Automata and Computability), we felt the use of similar
terms as befitting.

Jove, the software offered here, takes a different approach than
JFLAP in that it aims to expose students to a ``Read/Eval/Print''
style of interaction within Jupyter notebooks. They also profit
from reading the Jove source code -- another form of education not
obtained by merely interacting with a piece of software.

Jove is described almost in its entirety in its README.md file 

# Jove License 

Jove Version 1.0, draft begun February 18, 2018.

Jove was written by Ganesh Gopalakrishnan as part of his forthcoming
book ``Automata and Computability: A Programmer's Perspective'' (hereafter
abbreviated as ACPP).

Some of the example Turing machines used in Jove were written by Ian Briggs,
University of Utah. The section on Lambda Calculus was written entirely by
Ian Briggs, including the Python code. Jove also benefited from Michael Bentley
and Heath French, University of Utah, who contributed to the use of Jupyter widgets,
and also helped test the software.

Other acknowledgements, either for the ACPP book or the Jove software include:
Prof. John Brzozowski, University of Waterloo, Canada (proof-reading the ACPP
book and writing its Foreword), Dr. Ching-Tsun Chou, Intel Corporation,
Santa Clara, CA (for trying out Jove), and students who took CS 3100 (Models
of Computation) at the University of Utah during Fall 2017 (taught by
Ganesh Gopalakrishnan).

Jove immensely benefits from PLY (Python's Lexer and Yacc) written by David Beazley.
In fact, Jove introduces a markdown language for automata whose lexer and parser
are written using PLY. Plans to upgrade to SLY (Beazley-authored successor to PLY)
are in the works.

Jove also directly depends on the Jupyter notebook eco-system of software (jupyter.org)
as its features are directly dependent on Jupyter.
