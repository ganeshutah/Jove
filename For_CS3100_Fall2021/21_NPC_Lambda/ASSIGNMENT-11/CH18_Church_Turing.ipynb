    "# Definitions to illustrate Lambda Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda Calculus was introduced to mathematics (and hence to computer science) by Alonzo Church. The definitions in this notebook help demonstrate that the Lambda notation is surprisingly versatile and helps us encode a vast array of nontrivial calculations. It has in fact been shown that the Lambda notation is universal. It is known that any collection of primitives that includes operations on numbers, conditional branches and recursion is universal (\"Turing complete\"), and what this notebook shows is how to encode numbers, arithmetic, and conditional testing. We offer you the opportunity to carry out a suite of experiments to obtain an appreciation of the power of these primitives we provide. Further details of the universality of Lambda calculus may be found in the literature."

    "Alonzo Church proposed an interesting way to encode natural numbers: numbers 0, 1, 2, and so on. To represent number N belonging to this set, one merely builds a Lambda expression containing N applications of an abstract function \"b\" to another abstract function \"c\". In this sequel, we begin with the identity function I = lambda c: c, and then model ZERO (number 0) as lambda b: lambda c: c, or in other words, lambda b: I. It will be soon apparent what all these definitions lead to."

In mathematics, a value (or function) F such that F=G(F) is said to be a fixpoint of G. In the following, we will obtain these fixpoints by employing a fixpoint finder. The standard fixpoint finder is the Y combinator or Y function. Given that we are encoding all our concepts in Python which is an *eager* language (follows eager evaluation), we will term our Y combinator Ye (e for eager). \n",
    "\n",
    "What is eager evaluation, you might ask. We do not need to know all the details of this concept, but a high level explanation may leave you a bit more satisfied than otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eager versus lazy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply a function f to an argument E, written f(E), one could follow two approaches: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate E fully, obtaining some value (say v). Then apply f to v. This is the eager evaluation approach -- alternately known as call by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do not evaluate E one bit. Instead, assuming that the formal parameter of f is x, substitute E for x everywhere within the body of f. This is the non-eager evaluation approach, more properly termed lazy evaluation -- alternately known as call by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how these two approaches differ. Again, the quick answer is that the latter approach can avoid nontermination (infinite looping) in more cases. To see this, think of a function g which takes three arguments, say x, y, and z.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let g(x,y,z) be such that it evaluates x, and if found true, will evaluate and return y, ignoring z entirely. On the other hand, if x is found to be false, it will ignore y entirely and evaluate z.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now call g as follows: g(True, 0, InfLoop()), where InfLoop() is a function call of no arguments that simply goes into an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, since the first argument of g is the constant True, we can return the answer 0 under lazy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the other hand, with eager evaluation, the function call g(True, 0, InfLoop()) will be fixated on \"grinding down InfLoop() into a value v\" before it proceeds further with g's evaluation. Clearly, this results in the whole computation looping infinitely (which is unnecessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The eager Y combinator, Ye\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a functional programming afficianado likes to introduce Lambda calculus in terms of a fixpoint finder called Y. This function is often called the Y function (or Y combinator; the term combinator originates from another line of work on combinatory calculus, and is being mentioned in case you hear it by chance and wonder what that means). \n",
    " \n",
    "The Y combinator is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " Y = lambda f: ( (lambda x: f(x x)) (lambda x: f(x x)) )\n",
    " \n",
    "Unfortunately, this Y combinator is designed for those who work under the assumption of the lazy evaluation semantics. Python, however, supports only eager evaluation (call by value), and therefore we must take due precautions to avoid infinite looping. For this reason, we define a suitable Y combinator which we call Ye, and is different from Y. See the definition of Ye below."

    "We have been employing the term **the fixpoint** without batting an eyelid. While a general discussion is beyond the scope of these notes, we must say that in general, for a G function, there could be multiple fixpoints. Luckily for us, we are going to be dealing with only *total* functions -- that is, recursive definitions where the function does not infinitely loop for any argument. For such functions, there is only one fixpoint, and Ye will find that. We are thus justified in using the term **the fixpoint**."
