    "# LT = Leon Tran\n",
    "# JJ = John Jacobson\n",

    "\n",
    "## (1, TA) The first question is worth 25%. It asks you to design a CFG for (by now, our favorite) Lif language. Then, to test this CFG out, it asks you to directly convert the CFG to a PDA using the method described in class (and around Figure 12.12 of the book; the algorithm starts on Page 175).\n",
    "\n",
    "#  =============\n",
    "\n",
    "## (2, AO) This question has two parts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (a)  For 12%, you must first run Calculator_with_Parse_Tree_Drawing.ipynb. There you'll notice that you are given a Jove-based parser that parses expressions and calculates expressions. You'll be asked to compare this parser against Python's parser (by running Python on those expressions). If there are answer-differences, you are asked to look at the parse-trees generated by Jove and find out why you got Jove's answers. Then by suitably parenthesizing the Python expressions, you'll know what precedences Python assigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "## For Question 2(a), you'll be answering four questions Q1,2,3,4 as answers A1,2,3,4 in the space below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  =============\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (b)  For 13%, you will be first running  Drive_PDA_Based_Parsing.ipynb. There you will be running  two CFGs on PDA. They are \n",
    " * explore_pda(\"3+2*3\", pdaEamb, STKMAX=5)\n",
    " * explore_pda(\"3+2*3\", pdaE, STKMAX=7)\n",
    "\n",
    "### You will notice that the first call produces TWO parses, similar to that in Figure 11.3. This is because these parses are happening with respect to the grammar for \"E\" on Page 145. (The PDA will accept this string in 2 ways.) The latter call is with respect to a disambiguated grammar, namely the grammar for \"E\" on Page 146. This produces only one of these parses. (The PDA will accept in only one way.) \n",
    "\n",
    "## YOUR TASK in part (2b) of this assignment is to write out a derivation sequence for BOTH the ambiguous parses produced by pdaEamb.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For explaining how to write this sequence out, I have worked out for you the derivation sequence for the unambiguous parse (wrt pdaE). Your task is to IMITATE this approach and write out the derivation sequence for BOTH the ambiguous parses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For further background, notice something interesting from Page 140. There is a derivation sequence here, namely \n",
    "#### S => SS => (S)S => (SS)S => .... (finally) => ((())())() \n",
    "\n",
    "## The way in which derivation sequences connect to parse-trees is given in Figure 11.1. Basically, when a derivation sequence has S => SS, you can see how the parse-tree sprouts two \"S\" from one S. Then when SS => (S)S, it replaces the first S to be (S). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thus, by looking at a derivation sequence, one can indeed draw a Parse Tree !!\n",
    "\n",
    "## You may say that \"all this is well and good, but how do I know what derivation sequence that Jove used? And how do I draw a Parse Tree?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## But this is easy, as explaned now!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The printout of ```explore_pda(\"3+2*3\", pdaE, STKMAX=7)``` shows how the Instantaneous Descriptions of the PDA are listed -- one after the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "## By noticing what is popped from the stack and what gets pushed, you will be able to determine the derivation sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Again, I show you one example for pdaE below. below; you simply imitate this for  BOTH the pdaEamb parses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## =============\n",
    "\n",
    "## (3, LT) This question is worth 25%, and is based on the parser of regular expressions embedded within RE2_NFA_PT.ipynb. You'll simply follow the actions in this file, and answer the questions asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## =============\n",
    "\n",
    "## (4, JJ) This question is worth 25%, and asks you to develop a CFG for the set of strings over $\\Sigma=\\{0,1\\}$ where the number of $1$'s in $w$ are $>$ the number of $0$'s in $w$. Once you develop this CFG, you must convert it to a PDA using the direct conversion method, and then run the indicated tests.\n",
