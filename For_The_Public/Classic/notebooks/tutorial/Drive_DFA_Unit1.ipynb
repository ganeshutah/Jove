    "\n",
    "A regular language is specified by drawing a DFA. Once you finish drawing a DFA, you would have defined a regular language. (We will soon tell you why you might want to take the trouble of drawing DFA and obtain regular languages. For now, we will finish defining terms.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the aim is to not produce drawings. We aim to define a simple type of machine that represents goto based programs. we shall define the notion of a transition system and introduce a simple text-based markdown language that helps specify transition systems. Once the transition system is defined, a drawing can be automatically produced using utilities we provide. However we shall continue to say \"draw a DFA\" to mean \"specify a transition system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are an infinite number of DFAs that can denote the same regular language\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like 1+1 and 3-1 both denote number 2, and there are an infinite number of arithmetic expressions that denote 2, there are an infinite number of transition systems that denote the same regular language. But usually we don't write 364-362 in order to convey \"2\" (e.g., you seldom order (364-362) pancakes in a restaurant.) The same way, you try to specify the simplest possible DFA to denote a particular regular language -- not an artificially bloated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with numbers, we know that \"2\" is simpler than (364-362). With DFA, don't worry: even if you did not draw the simplest DFA, there is an automated tool that we shall give you that creates the simplest DFA. Yes, there is a unique simplest DFA called the minimal DFA for each regular language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are an infinite number of regular languages\n",
