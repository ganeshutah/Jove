    "# A markdown for machines\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the purposes of a Models of Computation course is to teach students some basic machine types. It is common practice to input these machines interactively using a graphical tool such as JFLAP, and to view their simulation results also in the same graphical environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical interactions are powerful and intuitive. They provide powerful visual cues that tell a student how the machines \"work\" in the sense of chugging along, should they be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a __graphics-only__ presentation for a machine typically studied in such a course is woefully deficient in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It does not really allow a user to write programs for these complex machines. Programs that are purely presented as pictures \n",
    " \n",
    " a. quickly get cluttered\n",
    " \n",
    " b. quickly become a sphagetti of edges, circles, and edge labels that bump into other graphical elements\n",
    " \n",
    "2. It does not allow us to write comments. Without comments:\n",
    "\n",
    " a. Others (and even the original authors) will find it difficult to understand their construction\n",
    " \n",
    " b. Critical structures such as loops cannot be adequately documented, unless one has a textual representation\n",
    " \n",
    "In a nutshell, leaving complex machine constructions as pictures alone can lead to constructions that go wrong more often than they would emerge right. Even everyday things such as sending a machine description to someone becomes a chore. Automated grading is that much more clumsy: one needs the graphical environment around.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prefer a textual input method for these machines, from which graphical drawings can be easily produced. More specifically, we devise a __markdown__ language for DFA, NFA, PDA and TM. Our language is called the \"automd\" language standing for \"automata markdown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A markdown approach has both advantages, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One gets the program in textual form with comments\n",
    "\n",
    "* One can _also_ generate a drawing very easily, thus preserving most of the advantages (if not all) of a picture-only input method\n",
    "\n",
    "* In future, we can convert our markdowns to inputs to programs such as JFLAP\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tool suite, we don't have a full graphical simulation output at this point. However, we do provide sufficiently rich textual outputs that adequately capture simulations. (These facilities are easy to extend based on user-feedback.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a single function md2mc() with arguments to be elaborated soon, but basically being the markdown input. This function produces an internal representation for the described machine (as a Python dictionary). This representation can be rendered as a drawing as well as simulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe how these are accomplished. Examples may be found in Jupyter notes Drive_md2mc. We now informally describe our markdown grammar and also provide its formal BNF grammar. (Incidentally, the markdown compiler forms a fantastic example that is worth studying. It has a regular grammar, but we use context-free productions to easily handle its constructs.)\n",
