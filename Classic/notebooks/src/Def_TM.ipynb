Halting configurations as well as paths leading to them are maintained.

This is like the gas in your tank! When you run out of gas, you are forced to halt.\n",

A run ends with a printout of the terminal configurations plus the fuel remaining per thread. This is ideal from the point of explaining nondeterministic runtimes. We elaborate now.\n",
