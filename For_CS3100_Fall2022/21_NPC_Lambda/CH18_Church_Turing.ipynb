    "# Definitions to illustrate Lambda Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda Calculus was introduced to mathematics (and hence to computer science) by Alonzo Church. The definitions in this notebook help demonstrate that the Lambda notation is surprisingly versatile and helps us encode a vast array of nontrivial calculations. It has in fact been shown that the Lambda notation is universal. It is known that any collection of primitives that includes operations on numbers, conditional branches and recursion is universal (\"Turing complete\"), and what this notebook shows is how to encode numbers, arithmetic, and conditional testing. We offer you the opportunity to carry out a suite of experiments to obtain an appreciation of the power of these primitives we provide. Further details of the universality of Lambda calculus may be found in the literature."

    "Alonzo Church proposed an interesting way to encode natural numbers: numbers 0, 1, 2, and so on. To represent number N belonging to this set, one merely builds a Lambda expression containing N applications of an abstract function \"b\" to another abstract function \"c\". In this sequel, we begin with the identity function I = lambda c: c, and then model ZERO (number 0) as lambda b: lambda c: c, or in other words, lambda b: I. It will be soon apparent what all these definitions lead to."

In mathematics, a value (or function) F such that F=G(F) is said to be a fixpoint of G. In the following, we will obtain these fixpoints by employing a fixpoint finder. The standard fixpoint finder is the Y combinator or Y function. Given that we are encoding all our concepts in Python which is an *eager* language (follows eager evaluation), we will term our Y combinator Ye (e for eager). \n",
